            I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering at
            Tula's Institute (expected Mar 2027), where I've focused on
            foundations like data structures, ML/AI, computer vision, and NLP.
            I'm strongest with Python-based ML stacks and building end-to-end
            systems that put models into production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most recently, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Vinci
            (Feb–Aug 2025), where I integrated generative models into the
            product pipeline using ComfyUI + FastAPI, built scalable backend
            services for inference routing and logging, and created automated
            evaluation harnesses to track model quality. Before that I interned
            at AK Digital Services (Jul 2024–Feb 2025), where I migrated
            front-end stacks to modern React/Node versions and implemented REST
            APIs used in A/B experiments. I've also done full-stack development
            work at OctaNet Services (Jan–Mar 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            My projects are ML-forward and deployment-focused: I've implemented
            inference batching, request queuing, and lightweight post-processing
            for diffusion and transformer models; built ETL pipelines and
            interactive dashboards (3rd place in UTKARSH 1.0); and worked on
            signal/EEG classification experiments for course and personal
            projects. I run reproducible experiments, instrument model
            evaluations, and ship production-ready prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I help run research and technical events as
            Secretary of the ACM Student Chapter (Jan 2025–Present) and I'm an
            NCC Senior Division Cadet — I attended the Advanced Leadership Camp
            (National Level) in October 2025. I also do digital art on the side
            and play a bit of CS2.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm open to full-time roles or research/engineering internships in
            cloud infrastructure, ML systems, or platform engineering.
